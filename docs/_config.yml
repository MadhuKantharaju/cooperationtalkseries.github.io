title: A Spotlight on Cooperation: from Behavior to the Brain

  Cooperation has been a major factor in driving the evolution of humans among other animals and is
believed to be vital for survival, reproductive success and social cohesion. Their most obvious
manifestation is evident in eusocial species like social insects, and naked mole rats [1], where intense
intraspecies interactions ensure their survival. Cooperation can result in immediate mutual benefit or
can be disadvantageous for one or more of the participants. This underplay of self-benefit for the
benefit of others creates an apparent dissonance that theories such as Hamilton’s kin selection [2]
have tried to bridge. The underlying neural mechanisms and representations determining such
cooperative strategies are still largely unknown, however, and have gained increased attention in
recent years.
We believe that a multidisciplinary perspective is best suited for enabling a broad discussion on the
complex topic of ‘cooperation’. Therefore, we aim to invite experts from different backgrounds and
hope to create new questions within the research. Topics within the talk series will cover a bandwidth
including neural correlates of empathy, eusociality and group based decision making. Within this
range, it addresses mechanisms and representations in the brain which are instrumental for
cooperative behavior between individuals, like understanding other’s perspectives and intentions. We
believe such an interdisciplinary talk series would engage a wide audience, especially researchers and
students interested in social interactions and computation of decision making, but also empathy,
animal cognition and the genetic underpinnings of cooperative and social behaviors.
In organizing the speaker series, we anticipate diversity, equity and inclusion by especially
encouraging speakers that belong to underrepresented groups within science to follow our invites.
